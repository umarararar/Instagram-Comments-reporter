# Instagram-Comments-reporter

# Working
You have to give a followers_output.txt file as an input. It will contain the usernames of instagram users. The bot will first go to the 1st username, 
then go to 1st post of that user and then check all of the comments. If the comment has a specific keyword that we input, the bot will report that 
comment and get the username of that commentor. The bot will then go to that user ID with different accounts that we give in the sheet and report him. 
After the commentor ID is reported, the bot will come back and check the next post. After all the posts are checked and commentors are reported, The bot 
will go on to the next user from the txt file and the process repeats. This bot is very useful when some celebrity is getting bullied. You can also checkout my
